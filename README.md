## NFLPA Data Competition

This repository is for a data project/competition completed in the winter of 2026 for the NFLPA Data Competition. My group explored the effects of bye week placement and short rest on injuries sustained during NFL games.

## What's in the repo?

In this repo, you can find all my code. The data came from R's `nflverse` package.

### R Scripts

-   `0a_import_data.R`: where I imported my raw dataset and conducted an initial evaluation
-   `1_data_analysis.R`: where I created my joined dataset using several `nflverse` datasets, conducted a quick EDA of the data, and tinkered with visualization tools.
